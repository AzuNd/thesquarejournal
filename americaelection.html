            <p>The POTUS is now well under way. It's going to be a permanent drumbeat until November. It is months away but couldn't it be just tomorrow? I mean what else is it to learn from any of these candidates, left and right?</p>
            
            <p>For now, the Delegates count favors H. R. Clinton on the democrats side and D. J. Trump on the republicans side. Secretary of State Clinton is half way in the delegates counting, and, this doesn't include the Superdelegates which, everybody believes, will all go to her. As for D Trump, the republican frontrunner, it looks like that he's going to take Florida which will likely seal the deal for him or lead to a contested/brokered, even if he loses Ohio to the governor-presidential candidate John Kasich</p>

            <p>A Contested Republican Convention will be a delight for anybody who is interested in politics. Just think about the theatics/tweets of D. Trump for two weeks. Better than any reality TV. I mean better than Seinfield and Dick Van Dyke combined and some more oddities. Contested (D. Trump doesn't reach the 1237 delegates and not automatically be the nominee) or brokered (alliances are formed between the remaining candidates or a third-party emerges supported by the delegates who are not bound by the caucuses/primaries results), there is the threat of "riots" from Trump supporters. Also, the option of a third-party seems unfeasable for the Republicans can't find a consensus candidate (actual running candidates or a Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan or...</p>

            <p>Democrats, on the other side of the political spectrum, have their own problem that nobody is addressing at this point. Yes, Secretary H. R. Clinton is sure to catch the nomination but she has the problem of bringing Sander's supporters on her side. This is complicated by the fact that Mrs. Clinton has a real problem with young women (remember "Feminism") and, in general, Millennials. Add the right-wing fabricated scandal of the emails and Benghazi and the character issue ("honesty"). Fabricated or not, it's sticking. It's another weakness of the Clinton camp: they don't know how to fight back; you would think that former Pr. Clinton around and all the campaigns/scandles Clinton has been through, she should be able to handle these smearing political campaigns. Apparently, she doesn't still get the how-to! So, now, after the nomination, the question is how is she going to reach out to them and bring them along in the general election</p>
